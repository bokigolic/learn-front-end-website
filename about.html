      Get the Tools You Need to Start
Basic Computer Specifications 
You can get started with web development using any machine capable of running Windows, macOS or Linux. The minimum requirements for programming include: 

Intel i5/i7 processor, or Apple Silicon processor on newer Macs
Full HD monitor or built-in laptop screen, ideally 1920×1080
8GB of RAM
Basic Text Editor
You’ll need a text editor to manage all the code you write. Thankfully, there are a lot of free options on the market to get you started. 

Notepad ++ is a good text editor for beginners, but it’s only available on Windows. Atom is another excellent option for Mac, Windows and Linux. 

Web Browsers
You’ll need a web browser to code. Given that you’re reading this article, you probably already have one! That said, downloading multiple browsers lets you make sure your site renders correctly across the web, so you should have more than one at your disposal. Popular options include Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Brave or Opera. 

Local Web Server
Setting up a local web server lets you test your code on your machine without publishing anything to the internet. You can test layouts, scripts and new features during the development process. 

XAMPP, for example, is a utility that can run a server on your Mac, Windows or Linux Machine. MAMP is another option for Mac and Windows only. 

Graphics Editor
Graphics editors can help developers create and edit graphical website elements. The Adobe Creative Suite is the industry standard, but its monthly fee might be steep if you’re new to design. For alternatives, check out GIMP (a free version of Adobe Photoshop) and Inkscape (a free version of Adobe Illustrator used for creating vector graphics).
